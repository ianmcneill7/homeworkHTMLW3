<p>The website says "never skip the endtag... What happens if we do?
<p>The website says many things. Including, "some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:" and the (p) is one of those elements.
</p>
<P> what happens when we forget the end tag for a HEADER? </P>

<h3> Did I ever tell you the definition of 'insanity'?

<p> Oh, and some tags like (p) are not case-sensitive (P)

<h2> Tags and Elements </h2>
<p> Each element defines a part of the document. (body) defines the "body" of the document.<br>
Then inside the 'body' there are other elements like (h1 to h6) for different headers. <br>
And (p) for paragraph.
